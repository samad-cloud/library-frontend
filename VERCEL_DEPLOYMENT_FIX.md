# Vercel Deployment Fix for Supabase Connection Issues

## Problem
Your Next.js app is experiencing fetch failures when connecting to Supabase on Vercel deployment. The errors show:
- `Error: fetch failed`
- `AuthRetryableFetchError: fetch failed { status: 0 }`

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Environment Variables** on Vercel
2. **Edge Runtime Compatibility** issues
3. **Network/DNS Resolution** problems in Vercel's environment

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration
I've updated your Supabase client files with:
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Custom fetch with timeout handling
- ✅ Better error logging
- ✅ Edge runtime compatibility improvements

### 2. Files Modified
- `utils/supabase/client.ts` - Browser client with timeout and validation
- `utils/supabase/server.ts` - Server client with enhanced error handling
- `utils/supabase/middleware.ts` - Middleware with improved fetch configuration
- `next.config.js` - Added edge runtime compatibility settings

### 3. New Utility Files
- `utils/supabase/config-check.ts` - Debug utility for environment variables

## Required Actions on Vercel

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables
Go to your Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Important:** 
- Make sure these are set for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments
- The values should be exactly the same as in your local `.env.local` file
- Double-check there are no extra spaces or characters

### Step 2: Verify Your Supabase URL
Your Supabase URL should look like:
```
https://your-project-id.supabase.co
```

From your `next.config.js`, I can see your Supabase domain is `nkjihejhyrquyegmqimi.supabase.co`, so your URL should be:
```
https://nkjihejhyrquyegmqimi.supabase.co
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
After setting the environment variables:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to trigger a fresh deployment

### Step 4: Test the Fix
1. Check your Vercel function logs for any remaining errors
2. Look for the new debug messages from our enhanced configuration
3. Test authentication flows on your deployed app

## Debug Information

### Check Environment Variables
Add this to any page to debug (remove after testing):

```typescript
import { checkSupabaseConfig } from '@/utils/supabase/config-check'

// In your component or API route
useEffect(() => {
  checkSupabaseConfig()
}, [])
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Environment variables not loading
**Solution:** Ensure variables are named exactly `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

#### Issue: Still getting fetch errors
**Solution:** 
1. Check Vercel function logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your Supabase project is active and not paused
3. Check Supabase dashboard for any API issues

#### Issue: Works locally but not on Vercel
**Solution:**
1. Compare local `.env.local` with Vercel environment variables
2. Ensure all environments (production/preview) have the variables set
3. Try a fresh deployment

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Timeout Handling
- Added 30-second timeouts for server/client requests
- Added 15-second timeout for middleware (faster for user experience)

### 2. Better Error Logging
- Enhanced error messages with context
- Added client info headers for debugging

### 3. Edge Runtime Compatibility
- Added external packages configuration for Supabase
- Improved fetch handling for Vercel edge runtime

## Next Steps
1. Set the environment variables on Vercel
2. Redeploy your application
3. Monitor the logs for improved error messages
4. Test authentication functionality

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, please share:
1. Your Vercel function logs
2. Any new error messages
3. Confirmation that environment variables are set correctly
